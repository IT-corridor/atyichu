0. TERMS

1. With what version of python you work.
    Python 2.7
1.1. Django version?

2. Do you have a ssh access to your server.

3. I hope you do not require REST interface, because you did not describe it at your task. 
But I saw some code using Django REST Framework in project that you have sent me. 

4. That project. (my task). Will it be absolutely independent project from other part? 
Or it will using the same database?

5. I need a ssh public key of your server (need to deploy this project). Not now.
Questions about the project:

1. Login page

1.1 Only login page, without registration?

2. Commodity

2.1. Commodity model / table structure. Does catalog, size, color and etc 
should be references to another tables (foreign keys)? Or it is just CHAR values?

2.2. I need a logic (pseudocode) generating and a sample of RFID code

2.3. What does it mean --- "commodity tag". What it should looks like?

2.4. Only authenticated user can access to commodity views?


3. User profile

3.1. What does means that string "Location: State:City:District:Street:Building:NO." ?
Does it describes a fields in the db? Or is it a format of one db field? 
If it is a list of db fields: should state and city be represented by own tables
 and referenced by foreign keys in the user table?
3.2. Pretty strange to have a "brand name" at user model/table.
